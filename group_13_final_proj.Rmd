Rough Outline of Project:

* Describe the goal/motivation of the project; have some stats and facts to explain our purpose in investigating this dataset
* Describe the dataset: where is it from, what does it contain
* Review the questions we intend on answering 
* Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Give an overview of the demographics of our dataset, any conclusion we make is only relevant to those who were stopped which is why it is good to give an idea of who is represented
    * histogram of race/build/etc.
    * distribution of continuous variables
  * Logistic Regression
    * odds of frisked
    * odds of arrest
  * Trends over time
    * could maybe find a way to test this, i.e. linear regression, is the slope equal to zero, or something of that nature. the plot shows a funnel pattern so maybe we could look into that more
  * other things
* Findings/Discussion

Read in and tidy the data

The following code:

* Reads in the data
* Renames columns to be more informative
* Combines height columns into a single height in inches
* Converts date_stop to date data type
* Converts time_stop to time data type
* Recodes the values in categorical columns to be more informative
* Selects column subset for further analysis

# Looks like there is also an entire row of NA's

Building a model using only characteristics, demographics, and location as predictors for frisked
 - assess multicolinearity to determine if there are any variables that exhibit high correlation 
 - We will remove any variables that exhibit signs of multicollinearity 
 - From this model, we can assess of those who were stopped, what are the odds of getting frisked based on certain characteristics, demographics and location predictors
    - IMPORTANT: we cannot make any causal statements from this model 'i.e. you have a higher odds of getting stopped if you are X race' because everyone in this dataset was stopped
    
```{r}

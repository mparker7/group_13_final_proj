<h2> The motivation for this project </h2>

Stop and Frisk has been a controversial police tactic used for years as a way to briefly stop and search civilians who are of suspect. Police must have "reasonable suspicion" according to the fourth amendment to legally stop a person. Utilizing NYC Stop and Frisk data, we want to develop a predictive model, visualize the data across the five New York City Boroughs, and describe the scope of our dataset.

<h2> The intended final products </h2>
Our final products will include a report summarizing our final results, the process we took to analyz the 2016 Stop & Frisk Data Set, as well as a complimentary website that will detail the final report. There will also be interactive visualizations and displays to help guide readers through our report's findings. 

<h2> Data sources </h2>
Our data source is going to be the publicly available data from NYC/the NYPD located [Stop and Frisk Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page)

We intend on using the data set published from 2016, due to its completeness within the data as well as its data dictionary. 

If we should need any additional data (like neighborhood demographics, etc.), we will acquire it from NYC's public database [additional data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).

<h2> The planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges </h2>

We plan to develop a logistic regression model through variable selection and LASSO regression modeling, visualize demographics, and develop an interactive map to display the data.

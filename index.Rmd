<h2> The motivation for this project </h2>

Stop and Frisk has been a controversial police tactic used for years as a way to briefly stop and search civilians who are of suspect. Police must have "reasonable suspicion" according to the fourth amendment to legally stop a person. Utilizing NYC Stop and Frisk data, we want to give insight into the most influential factors of those who are targeted by the Stop and Frisk tactic.

<h2> The intended final products </h2>
Our final products will include a report summarizing our final results, and our entire analytical process of the 2016 Stop & Frisk Data Set, as well as a complimentary website that will provide access and curate the final report; creating visualizations and interactional displays to help guide readers through our report's findings. 

<h2> Data sources </h2>
Our anticipated data source is going to be the publicly available data from NYC/the NYPD located [Stop and Frisk Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page)

We intend on using the data set published from 2016 since the only complete data dictionary we could locate is from the 2016 data set.

If we should need any additional data (like neighborhood demographics, etc.), we will most likely get them from NYC's public database [additional data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).
